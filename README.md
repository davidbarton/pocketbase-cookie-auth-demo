# pocketbase-cookie-auth-demo

> Disclaimer: You should use the PocketBase API methods with their powerful built-in authorization if you can. This demo exists for those edge cases where API methods are not an option (disabled JS).

The goal of this demo is to showcase a naive implementation of cookie based authentication flow for PocketBase [https://pocketbase.io](https://pocketbase.io).
